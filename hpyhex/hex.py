'''
This module implements a simplified and optimized hexagonal grid system designed for machine learning applications. 
The system is built with memory efficiency and computational performance in mind, leveraging several key optimizations:
1. Flyweight Pattern in Hex Class:
    - The `Hex` class uses a flyweight pattern to cache instances of small hexagonal coordinates, reducing memory usage.
    - It directly applies line coordinates (i, k) instead of raw coordinates (i, j, k), simplifying calculations and improving performance.
2. Pre-Cached Singleton Piece Class:
    - The `Piece` class represents a logical structure of 7 blocks using a pre-cached singleton pattern.
    - All possible states (0-127) are precomputed and stored, allowing for efficient reuse and memory savings.
3. Boolean-Based Grid Representation:
    - Neither the `Piece` class nor the `HexEngine` class stores actual block data.
    - Instead, they use boolean arrays to represent the occupancy state of blocks, significantly reducing memory overhead.
4. Enhanced Compatibility:
    - The system is designed to be compatible with tuples and lists, making it easier to integrate with other Python libraries and frameworks.
5. Comprehensive Documentation:
    - The module is thoroughly documented, providing clear explanations of the design, functionality, and usage of each class and method.
Classes:
    - `Hex`: Represents a hexagonal grid coordinate using a custom line-based coordinate system.
    - `Piece`: Represents a shape or unit made up of 7 blocks, optimized with a pre-cached singleton pattern.
    - `HexEngine`: Provides a complete engine for managing a hexagonal grid, including operations like adding pieces, eliminating lines, and computing entropy.
Usage:
    This module is ideal for applications requiring efficient hexagonal grid management, such as games, simulations, or machine learning tasks.

from typing import Union

class Hex:
    """
    Represents a hexagonal grid coordinate using a custom line-based coordinate system.

    This class models hexagonal positions with two line coordinates (i, k), implicitly
    defining the third axis (j) as `j = k - i` to maintain hex grid constraints.
    It supports standard arithmetic, equality, and hashing operations, as well as
    compatibility with coordinate tuples.

    For small grids, Hex instances are cached for performance, allowing more efficient memory usage
    and faster access. The caching is limited to a range of -64 to 64 for both i and k coordinates.

    Use of Hex over tuples is recommended for clarity and to leverage the singleton feature of small Hexes.

    Coordinate Systems:
        - Raw Coordinates (i, j, k): Three axes satisfying i + j + k = 0, where
          each axis is diagonal to the others at 60° increments.
        - Line Coordinates (i, k): Derived coordinates representing distances
          perpendicular to axes, simplifying grid operations.

    Note:
        - This class is immutable and optimized with __slots__.
        - Raw coordinate methods (__i__, __j__, __k__) are retained for backward compatibility.
        - Only basic functionality is implemented; complex adjacency, iteration,
          and mutability features are omitted for simplicity.

    Attributes:
        i (int): The line i coordinate.
        j (int): The computed line j coordinate (k - i).
        k (int): The line k coordinate.

class HexEngine:
    '''
    The HexEngine class provides a complete engine for managing a two-dimensional hexagonal
    block grid used for constructing and interacting with hex-based shapes in the game.

    The engine does not actually contain any blocks, but instead contains a list of booleans
    representing the occupancy state of each block in the hexagonal grid. The correspondence is achieved
    through optimized indexing and coordinate transformations.

    Grid Structure:
    - Uses an axial coordinate system (i, k), where i - j + k = 0, and j is derived as j = i + k.
    - Three axes: I, J, K. I+ is 60° from J+, J+ is 60° from K+, K+ is 60° from I-.
    - Raw coordinates: distance along an axis multiplied by 2.
    - Line-coordinates (I, K) are perpendicular distances to axes, calculated from raw coordinates.
    - Blocks are stored in a sorted array by increasing raw coordinate i, then k.

    Grid Size:
    - Total blocks for radius r: Aₖ = 1 + 3*r*(r-1)
    - Derived from: Aₖ = Aₖ₋₁ + 6*(k-1); A₁ = 1

    Machine Learning:
    - Supports reward functions for evaluating action quality.
    - check_add discourages invalid moves (e.g., overlaps).
    - compute_dense_index evaluates placement density for rewarding efficient gap-filling.

    Attributes:
        radius (int): The radius of the hexagonal grid, defining the size of the grid.
        states (list[bool]): A list of booleans representing the occupancy state of each block in the grid.

    def compute_entropy(self) -> float:

        Compute the entropy of the hexagonal grid based on the distribution of 7-block patterns.

        Entropy is calculated using the Shannon entropy formula, measuring the randomness of block
        arrangements in the grid. Each pattern consists of a central block and its six neighbors,
        forming a 7-block hexagonal box, as defined by the _get_pattern method. The entropy reflects
        the diversity of these patterns: a grid with randomly distributed filled and empty blocks
        has higher entropy than one with structured patterns (e.g., all blocks in a line or cluster).
        A grid with all blocks filled or all empty has zero entropy. Inverting the grid (swapping
        filled and empty states) results in the same entropy, as the pattern distribution is unchanged.

        The method iterates over all blocks within the grid's radius (excluding the outermost layer
        to ensure all neighbors are in range), counts the frequency of each possible 7-block pattern
        (2^7 = 128 patterns), and computes the entropy using the Shannon entropy formula:
            H = -Σ (p * log₂(p))
        where p is the probability of each pattern (frequency divided by total patterns counted).
        Blocks on the grid's boundary (beyond radius - 1) are excluded to avoid incomplete patterns.

        Returns:
            entropy (float): The entropy of the grid in bits, a non-negative value representing the randomness
                   of block arrangements. Returns 0.0 for a uniform grid (all filled or all empty)
